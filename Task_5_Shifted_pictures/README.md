Here there is a solution for the following task:

    Shift the columns/rows of a picture cyclically.
    1. The number of MPI processors can be chosen arbitrarily, not depending on the picture width.
    2. Plot the speedup vs number of processors.
    3. Plot memory consumption vs number of processors.

I could not upload the obtained animation (.gif) to github as its size exceeds 25 MB.
