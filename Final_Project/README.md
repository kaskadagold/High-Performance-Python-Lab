The Final Project for the "High Performance Python Lab" course was devoted to the image compression problem. Here you can find the implementation of discrete cosine transform (DCT) technique, which is widely used in signal processing and data compression. 

Moreover, the project also contains the comparison of running time of 3 different implementations: 1) with _NumPy_-library; 2) with parallelization (_mpi4py_-package); 3) with jit compiler (_Numba_).
