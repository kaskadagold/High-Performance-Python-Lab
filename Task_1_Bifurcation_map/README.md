  In the file 'Implementation_and_plotting.ipynb', you can find the implementation of the bifurcation map according to the following guide:

  In the file 'MPI_NumPy_comparison.ipynb', parallelization was achieved using <i>mpi4py</i> package. Moreover, it was calculated how it allows one to speed up the program.

<p>
  The final file 'CuPy_MPI_NumPy_comparison.ipynb' compares 3 different implementations of the task: the first is the initial code, the second is parallelized with MPI, and the third is accelerated with <i>CuPy</i> package, which enables one to work with GPU rather than CPU.
