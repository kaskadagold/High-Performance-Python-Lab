  In the file <b>'MPI_NumPy_comparison.ipynb'</b>, parallelization was achieved using <i>mpi4py</i> package. Moreover, it was calculated how it allows one to speed up the program.

<p>
  The final file <b>'CuPy_MPI_NumPy_comparison.ipynb'</b> compares 3 different implementations of the task: the first is the initial code, the second is parallelized with MPI, and the third is accelerated with <i>CuPy</i> package, which enables one to work with GPU rather than CPU.
