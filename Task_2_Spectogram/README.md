A spectrogram is a plot of signal intensity versus time and frequency. It is produced using the windowed Fourier transform. 
The file ___'Implementation.ipybn'___ contains the following hometask:
1. Add 4th wave packet with frequency = 4 and time_shift = 7 cycles to the given one. Demonstrate the effect on the plot of the FFT spectrum.
2. Implement the spectrogram, show the effect of (1) on the spectrogram. Label the axes.
3. Change the number of time steps in your signal to the power of 2 and then slightly change the number of timesteps. Measure the timing, can you explain the difference? Write something as a possible explanation.

In the file ___'MPI_NumPy_comparison.ipybn'___, it is shown how this program can be speed up with _mpi4py_ package.
